# fn Toggle
Small menu bar app for OS X that adds a quick option to toggle the fn key functionality. Built with Swift.

Must allow fn Toggle to control computer in Settings > Security & Privacy.
This tweak works best for me if I let it run at login by enabling it in Settings > Users & Groups > Login Items

Would like to add some functionality like CMD+Click or right click to toggle.
